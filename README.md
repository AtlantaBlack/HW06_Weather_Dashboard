# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Utilising server-side APIs allows web developers to make websites that deliver a whole lot more content and/or data to their web application's users, and faster. Depending on the information needed, a developer can focus on the web application itself without needing to worry about building and maintaining a database for information that may constantly change.

A weather dashboard is a perfect example of using publicly accessible server-side APIs to retrieve forecast information from any city in the world. 

This application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather details of a user-specified city. It then saves that information into local storage and displays the results of the city's current weather at the present moment plus forecast data for the next five days.
