# BCS HW 06 - Weather Dashboard
Application that shows current weather and future forecast for specified city


# BCS HW 04 - Weather Dashboard

## Description

Integrating Javascript into a website or application adds a whole new way for users to engage with the content in that website or application. It enhances functionality by introducing dynamic elements to an otherwise static page, which makes a much more interesting user experience overall.

This project is an interactive quiz that allows users to test their knowledge with questions about Javascript basics. The project itself was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and utilises Web Browser APIs, such as local storage, to send and retrieve user data (in this case, quiz high scores).

To a new developer, the challenges presented in the construction of this project were numerous, and difficult. I found thinking about how to piece together the different functions and, especially, _where_ to place them in the overall code structure was just as tough as writing the code correctly in the first place.
